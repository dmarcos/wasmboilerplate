# WebAssembly Boilerplate

Develop a C++ program for both native :computer: and Web :earth_africa: simultaneously.

I love the portability, low level control and minimalism of the C language. The convenience, immediacy and global reach of Web publication are also unmatched in other platforms.

This repo is an attempt at combining the best of both worlds.


It relies on Emscripten tool chain for WASM compilation and Visual Studio build tools for native (MacOS support coming soon)

The only requirement is a Windows system with git. The rest is installed on demand if needed.

Emscripten, Visual studio build tools and Python are automatically installed locally in the directory if not found in the system.
